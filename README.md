# ML-Project--Employee-Turnover-Analytics
Project on Employee Turnover Analytics, created for Portobello Tech!

In this project, I used a combination of data analysis, clustering, SMOTE for handling class imbalance, and k-fold cross-validation to predict turnover risk and identify key factors behind employee departures. 

I trained and compared models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting, evaluating them through ROC/AUC, classification reports, and confusion matrices to find the best performer. Finally, I categorized employees into risk zones and suggested retention strategies tailored for each. It was rewarding to blend machine learning insights with real-world HR challenges, aiming to make workplaces more supportive and sustainable.
